# Endless Rusting

## About
Endless Rusting was origionaly made because I wanted to try learn java, but now I'm continuing to work on it because I'm finding it fun. The mod is about fleshing out the lore of PTER, and adding new mechanics which fit with vanilla.

## V7 Compatability
I've got plans for full v7 compatability, though I'm not sure whats to come. Units are now compatable, and so is the dialog, but I've got to wait and see if everything works for the next BE build.

## Compiling

### Required applications
- JDK 8.

### Windows

Plain Jar: gradlew build
Dexify Plain Jar: gradlew dexify
Build Plain & Dexify Jar: gradlew buildDex

Note: Preferably use the plain jar for windows. If you're compiling for an android user, build the dexed jar instead. Dexed jars tend to be much larger, and are unescecary if you can compile a plain jar.

### Desktop/Mac

Plain Jar: ./gradlew build
Dexify Plain Jar: ./gradlew dexify
Build Plain & Dexify Jar: ./gradlew buildDex

Note: Preferably use the plain jar for windows. If you're compiling for an android user, build the dexed jar instead. Dexed jars tend to be much larger, and are unescecary if you can compile a plain jar.


## Mechanics

### Researchable Blocks ingame
This one's a big one. Certain blocks now require both researching in the Tech tree (In campaign) and researching ingame to use. This will Stop you from simply rushing down the new Technology. To compensate though, the researchable blocks are stronger than their vanilla counterparts, or feature some new mechanic. Most research costs are below a thousand of one materiel, though they tend to be mixed depending on the block's usage and practical applications.

### Pulse
A weird substance which is simulated by mindustry, and is colletable from the air.
Used in various tech, such as defense, production and support

### Mount Abiities
Units can have abilities which draw as though they are weapons. Various mounts can do difrent things such as charging up building, or healing units.
At the moment, theres only one unit which is planed to have these, with two types of mounts and no weapons.

### Smart AI
As it turns out, having untis which can do various tasks isn't to powerfull. The new suport units in this mod are able to
- Mine resources and bring them abck to the core
- Defend themselves or other units
- Track down damaged allies and heal them
- Flee back to repair points or cores
- Prioritize targets next to damaged allies

### Damaging Weather
Weather which can rain bullets from the sky has been added! I'm working to make the impact of the weather on gameplay noticible enough that it becomes something that the player should think about, but not be the entire focus of their time spent in the storm.

## New Status Effects

### Spreading Status Effects
The more the merrier, untill theres a ton of infected units with no way to heal them all. Spreading status effects tend to be applied for longer, do less damage and tend to have some quirk that affects the unit directly.

### Crystal status effects
Slows the unit down drasticaly, and draws a spiky crystal around it. That's about it.
